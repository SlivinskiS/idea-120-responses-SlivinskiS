In an ever changing field of interactivity, videogames have taken the world by storm with their vast array of styles and themes. 
There is something for everyone out there. Well, almost. 
With  interactive media becoming more and more popular every year, people are finding its advantages in personal expression.

Diversification in interactive media is becoming more and more important and relavent. As accessability to gaming and coding is increasing, so is the diversity of minds contributing to the platform.
For example, story lines and plots take on more complex and nuanced forms as those with a deeper insight into the human psyche learn how to string code together. 
Similarly, people with different experiences and outlooks on life are able to share their viewpoints in an abstract and interactive way. 

Throughout gaming history, there have been frequent themes of overly heroic protagonists, both male and female. 
But, in an ever growing society with growing diversity, characters in games have seen a rapid expansion in relateable attributes and personalities.
I'd like think that this can be linked to the growing popularity and availablity of interactive media tools for more voices to speak through.
