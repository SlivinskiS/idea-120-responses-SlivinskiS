<h>Murray and "The Mandalorian"</h>

<p>Many of the examples and points Murray makes in this chapter do ring true to how interactive media has evolved.
Throughout this chapter, one example of how Murray’s vision of interactive media has come to life is the episode “Bandersnatch” from the Netflix original series “Black Mirror”. 
In this episode, the viewer is allowed to choose which decisions the main character makes. This leads them down a spider web of possible plot twists and endings for the episode.
Indeed, the viewer is drawn to rewatch the episode over and over again, picking and discovering new branches of the story as they go. 
This deviates from the previously linear plotlines of all other episodes from this series. The interactivity makes for a very successful mode of storytelling through digital media!</p>

<p>Learning about the LED screens used in “The Mandalorian” was an eye opener.
In the movies, green screens have been so heavily used, especially in the bigger film series like “The Avengers” and “The Hobbit”. 
But when considering Murray’s definition of “layers”, it is clear to see that the LED screens eliminate one or two layers compared to green screens. 
For instance, when using green screens, actors, film directors, and set designers would have to “imagine” where certain important landmarks would be. 
Not only does this have the potential to cause confusion, but it also makes for less genuine reactions to certain events on set. 
With the LED screens, not only are the actors and film makers able to look exactly where they are directed, but the set designers can more easily project their ideas at a moment’s notice onto the screens. 
All of this makes for a more genuine feeling of presence for the viewers after everything is filmed.</p>
