All three of this week’s readings struck a chord with me, and feel relevant to what is occurring in todays’ society.
Mona’s TED Talk really hit the nail on the head in terms of how precarious statistics can be. 
As a skeptic myself, I found her explanation of why societal statistics are important to be eye opening. 
She is right in posing the question of how can we solve society’s issues without data to solve them?
With all of the data charts being constantly pushed in our faces over COVID and the election, I find it very easy to become overwhelmed. 
But Mona’s strategies for finding possible weak points in a statistic offers me some sense of comfort. 
At least now I can know which numbers to actually pay attention to.

In the WMD reading, I couldn’t help but feel angered by the information presented. Targeted ads have always seemed questionable to me. 
I feel that they are predatory and invasive, and the example of the for-profit online colleges is a prime example. 
I had no idea just how aggressively pinpointed these ads were, specifically targeting single low-income moms, veterans returning with PTSD, and others with no where to turn and no foothold in a career. 
Even more disturbing still was the mention of the marketing manual which encouraged the targeting of this demographic of individuals. 
I think targeted ads makes the internet a more dangerous place than convenient. 

Typeface, however, seems like a helpful tool for the internet. It seems like the least harmful form of increasing interaction on the internet.
Effective typeface seems like a fundamental of good design, and seeks to enhance readability. 
Without effective typeface, the internet would read in only one voice. In my personal experience, I use specific typefaces when making new Instagram posts.
It is interesting to see the varying amounts of engagement when I use more “elegant” typefaces.
