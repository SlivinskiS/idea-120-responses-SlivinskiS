For project 4, there are a couple ideas I have floating around in my head.
But I think I would like to create a non linear story around the contents of a college girl's nightstand.
I envision telling a story through various objects, for example, a polaroid of an old boyfriend, or a pill bottle of anxiety medication.
I think this would be a piece to really dig deep with. The objects can be quirky, meaningful, or perhaps even sinister.
