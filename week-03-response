In this image of an instagram influencer, the first message is the iage itself. 
As stated in the reading, there are plenty of dicontinuous elements to be pointed out as iconic messages.
Because instagram is a highly visual form of social media, most poeple will read into the image before the caption.
The girl in the image has a smile on her face and is wearing trendy clothing, which speaks to the popular "casual but chic" vibe.
In her hand is a box of Special K cereal, which is the second message along with the caption.
The linguistic message on the box highlights the "nourish" label, which goes along with what the influencer talks about in the caption.
Her caption highlights the idea of a new year's resolution, which is something that must be "nourished" to accomplish.
She invites all of her followers to "join" her, which has the potential to make anyone who buys the cereal feel like they are actively interacting with her.
