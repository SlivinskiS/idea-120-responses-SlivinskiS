<h>"Weapone of Math Destruction" Response</h>

<p>“Weapons of Math Destruction” has opened my eyes to the reality of how information is processed in the 21st century.
Math has never been my strong suit throughout my educational career. I would get consistently low grades scores on math tests throughout high school and college. 
But this brought something to mind…did that necessarily make me an incompetent student? Well, according to the ACT and SAT, yes. And this is an example of a WMD.</p>

<p>I remember as a junior in high school, the ACT test was “The Big One”. The test that determined your worth as an investment to future colleges. 
The one that parents would buy their “gifted” students giant textbooks on how to study and pass. 
And ultimately, the one that I would end up getting a less than satisfactory score on, regardless of how many AP and honors classes I was enrolled in. 
Much like Sarah Wysocki, the fifth-grade teacher who was fired for her poor score on the IMPACT test, I wondered how on earth this could have happened. 
My reading and writing scores were beyond exemplary, but once again, it came down to my poor mathematics score that dashed my hopes of getting any score above a 30.</p> 

<p>I had the option to retake the ACT test, but I did not take it. To me, it seemed rigged. 
It felt that no matter how hard I studied, or how many grueling exercises I’d go through in the massive “How to Pass the ACT” textbook…the algorithm was stacked against me. 
To this day, I wonder how many other “gifted” students were crushed under the algorithm. How many “gifted” students are STILL being crushed.
I remember throwing that textbook into the blazing bonfire at my senior graduation party, and praying that by the time I had children, this poor metric for intelligence would be eliminated.</p>
