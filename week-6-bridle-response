As an avid YouTube guru, this reading resonated VERY deeply with me. I have been watching Pewdiepie since 2012, and even he has brought up this very same issue multiple times. 
Many of the big Youtubers including Markiplier and Jacksepticeye have all brought this issue to light over and over again. 
Yet, there is still nothing being done about it. That being said, I absolutely agree with Bridle’s concerns. 
I have seen it myself, and even experienced it to a mild degree when I was younger. 
I share Bridle’s concern that this horrific content is being chugged out at a massive scale, so even though many can get “striked” or taken down, there are hundreds more just like it being posted.
And the worst part is that it’s being targeted at children.  

Bridle seems to want to foster an internet where children can explore and discover at their own pace. 
However, the algorithm of today’s internet will divert to dark and uncalled for content far too easily.
There is far less navigation involved to find the darker parts of the internet, even in a channel marketed for kids.
Maybe that’s because of the sheer volume of randomized content that is simply made for revenue. Bots are everywhere on the internet now. 
The genuineness of content creation has been thrown out the window in favor of just making as much money as possible with a minimum amount of effort. 
An example of this that Bridle used was the channel completely devoted to just opening Kinder eggs. 
As a whole, more responsibility is being diverted to parents in what their child watches. YouTube has become a field of traumatizing video landmines.
