<h1>Salter reading</h1>

<p>In the Salter reading, there were several topics that caught my attention. Topics that could be tied back to how art is transforming in today’s society. 
The concept of Gesamtkunstwerk seemed a bit confusing to me at first. But the more I read about the history behind how this concept came to be, the more I was ale to relate it to the art forms of the 21st century.</p>

<p>When reading about “Victory Over the Sun”, it made me think about how a masterpiece doesn’t necessarily have to be high fidelity. 
In the performance, set and costume designer Kazimir Malevich used 2D painted backgrounds and costumes made of carboard for the actors. 
Composer Mikhail Matyushin formed what was described as “…banged out of an out-of-tune piano and accompanied by an equally out-of-tune student choir…”. 
This concept of low fidelity brought to mind how some of the internet’s first most beloved interactive masterpieces were very simple and crude. 
“ELIZA” and “Zork” are modern day examples of Gesamtkunstwerk, but they, too, carried very basic concepts.</p> 

<p>Now, there are planet of examples of much more complicated forms of Gesamtkunstwerk that are available in 2020. 
Since the rise of interactive gaming, there has been a growing thirst for games that go beyond point and click, or aim and shoot. 
An example of this would be the videogame “Until Dawn”. This game requires more than just basic gaming mechanics to get through. 
The gamer is required to make their own decisions throughout the game. 
Picking which responses to give each character, choosing which path to escape from danger, and even being required to hold the gaming control completely still while in certain situations so as not to kill their character.
The stimulation of more than just visual senses is what makes this game a masterpiece.</p>
