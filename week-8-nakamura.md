When it comes to interactive media, it's easy to see it through the window of our own mind and our own personal understanding.
But it is also a window into the creator's identity and how they view the world. Interactive media is art. And art is expression through the individual who is creating said art.
So when we look at a website, or a video game, or a media platfrom, it stands to reason that the creator chose the layout very specifically. Whether it be due to their culture, or their individual mindset.

There are many digital media tools that I myself use througout my day to day life. 
I am sending and recieving emails through Gmail, I use Instagram for both my professional modeling and personal expression, and I use TikTok as a main source of entertainment. 
When I consider the core purpose behind each of these platforms, I can start to read into some of the creative and personal motives behind each.
